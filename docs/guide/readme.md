# Bonsai Guide

This is meant to be a practical guide to understanding Bonsai apps,
touring through the major parts of the libraries that you'll use.

See also the [getting started guide](../getting_started/index.md) for a
hands-on tutorial that takes you from zero to completing a couple very
simple Bonsai apps. (That guide also gives some background on what
motivated Bonsai, if you're new to web development in OCaml, or web
development in general.)
